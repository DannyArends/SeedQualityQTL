## Seed Quality QTL mapping pipeline with MQM in R
This repository contains the code used to produce the results for the paper:

- Visualizing the genetic landscape of Arabidopsis seed performance: 
Ronny V. L. Joosen*, Danny Arends*, Leo Willems, Wilco Ligterink, Henk Hilhorst, Ritsert C. Jansen - Plant Physiology (2011)

This repository contains a single script.R which can be sourced into R 

    setwd("/path/to/script")
    source("script.R")

The analysis is then performed using a configuration file, for an example see the config.txt file.
